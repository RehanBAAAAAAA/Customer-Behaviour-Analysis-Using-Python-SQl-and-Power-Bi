# Customer-Behaviour-Analysis-Using-Python-SQl-and-Power-Bi
Customer Behaviour Data Analysis is a data analytics project built using Python, SQL, and Power BI to analyze customer purchasing patterns, engagement trends, and business insights. The project covers data cleaning, transformation, exploratory data analysis (EDA), SQL querying, and interactive dashboard creation
# Customer Behaviour Data Analysis Project

Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing customer behaviour using **MySQL, Python, and Power BI** to extract meaningful insights for business decision-making. The project demonstrates a complete end-to-end data analytics pipeline including data storage, querying, transformation, analysis, and interactive visualization.
The objective is to understand customer patterns, purchasing behaviour, segmentation, and performance trends through structured data analysis and dashboard reporting.

Tech Stack

* **Database:** MySQL (MySQL Workbench)
* **Programming:** Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib)
* **Visualization:** Power BI
* **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook

MySQL (Database Layer)

The MySQL component contains:

* Database creation
* Table schemas
* Data insertion
* Cleaning queries
* Aggregations
* Joins
* Analytical queries
* Business insight queries

File:
`mysql/Customer_behaviour.sql`

This file can be executed in **MySQL Workbench** to recreate the complete database environment.
